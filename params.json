{"name":"Jekyll-flickr-photoset","tagline":"A Jekyll plugin for embedding Flickr photosets","body":"# jekyll-flickr-photoset\r\n\r\nIt's a Jekyll plugin for embedding Flickr photosets in your Liquid templates.\r\n\r\nI was moving from Posterous to Jekyll and I was looking for a slideshow gallery like Posterous had. You put a simple tag with a Flickr photoset ID inside your post and it builds a slideshow gallery. So I made it: one tag generates a gallery, no more. Dead simple.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of this integration: [http://blog.wildtrip.net](http://blog.wildtrip.net/)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% flickr_photoset 12345678901234567 %}\r\n{% flickr_photoset 12345678901234567 \"Square\" \"Medium 640\" \"Large\" \"Site MP4\" %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\n- `12345678901234567` is the Flickr photoset ID (can be found in this kind of url: `http://www.flickr.com/photos/j0k/sets/72157624158475427/`)\r\n- `\"Square\"` is the size for the thumbnail image (*which also the one by default*)\r\n- `\"Medium 640\"` is the size for the displayed image (*which also the one by default*)\r\n- `\"Large\"` is the size for the opened image (*which also the one by default*)\r\n- `\"Site MP4\"` is the format for the video in case photoset include a video (*which also the one by default*)\r\n\r\nOther Flickr size can be found [here](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getSizes.html).\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n#### FlickRaw\r\n\r\n*Flickraw is a library to access flickr API in a simple way.*\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install flickraw\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A Flickr API key\r\n\r\nYou can obtain a Flickr API key [here](http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/).\r\nAnd follow instructions on [the FlickRaw page for authentication](http://hanklords.github.com/flickraw/):\r\n\r\n  - create a `flickr.rb` file with content of \"Authentication\" bloc code\r\n  - replace api key by the one previously generated on the Flickr website\r\n  - launch it with `ruby -rubygems flickr.rb`\r\n  - follow instructions\r\n\r\nThen put them inside `_config.yml` (where `flickr:` is defined on the root level):\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nflickr:\r\n  cache_dir:       \"./_cache/flickr\"\r\n  api_key:          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n  shared_secret:    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n  access_token:     xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n  access_secret:    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also an ability to generate cache. It will put all images references from each photoset. It will save **a lot of time** when you will have to regenerate all your posts. Cache are written in a yml file. Photoset ID is the file name.\r\n\r\n#### Rendering\r\n\r\n##### [Foundation Clearing](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/clearing.html)\r\n\r\nThe master branch use Clearing, from Foundation, to display a kind of gallery. It handles a list of images, and a fullscreen slideshow.\r\n\r\n##### [AD Gallery](http://adgallery.codeplex.com/)\r\n\r\nThis is the plugin used to generate the slideshow gallery, which is almost the same from Posterous. You will find references in `adgallery` folder, I put the latest version (1.2.7).\r\n\r\nIf you want to use it, switch to the [ad-gallery](https://github.com/j0k3r/jekyll-flickr-photoset/tree/ad-gallery) branch. I didn't test it under Jekyll 1.0+.\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\nI've looked inside :\r\n\r\n- [jekyll-flickr](https://github.com/cnunciato/jekyll-flickr)\r\n- [Integrating Flickr and Jekyll](http://www.marran.com/tech/integrating-flickr-and-jekyll/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
